Who Cooks is a tool for organizing meals with multiple people. Perfect for Meal Trains or group trips or households that share cooking responsibility. The goal of Who Cooks is to offer a visual reference of who is cooking for the next week and what meal they will make. Who Cooks is integrated with Edamam API which allows a user to browse recipes for their meals and save it to the calendar for easy reference. 

Future development will make it easier to switch between week and month views, share calendars and offer more than one meal per day. 

Who Cooks was built with Ruby on Rails by a food enthusiast :)
